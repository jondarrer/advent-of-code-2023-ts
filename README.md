My solution to Advent of Code 3 in TypeScript https://adventofcode.com/2023

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

## Running

```bash
yarn start {day} {part}
```

To run day 1, part 1 type `yarn start 1 1`.

## Template for a new day's challenges

```bash
yarn run plop {day}
```

If the day is left out, then when prompted, type in the day number, e.g. `2`. The template files for both
parts of the day will be created in the `./src/day2` directory.
